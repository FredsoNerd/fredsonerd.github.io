I'm participating in the [EAGxLatimAmerica 2024](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-global/events/eagxlatinamerica-2024)! From the *feb 16th* to the *feb 18th* we'll be discussing relevant topics related to the Effective Altruism community agendas, including AI Safety and Governance, Pandemic Risks, and more.
